<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Kimberly Stachenfeld**](https://neurokim.com/) is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind. Her research lies at the interface of machine learning and neuroscience, and focuses on how brains and machines learn to predict future events. She is particularly interested in the process of learning structured models that support generalization and flexible reasoning. Recently, she has been interested in applying graph neural networks to learn physical simulations, in particular fluid simulation. Kimberly received her PhD in Neuroscience from Princeton University in 2018, and her BS/BA in Chemical & Biological Engineering and Mathematic from Tufts University in 2013. She was named one of the MIT Technology Review 35 Under 35 in 2019.
